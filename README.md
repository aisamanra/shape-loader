# shape-loader
A simple game for kids where you load shapes onto a truck

## To install dependencies and run:

You'll need `sdl2` and (I recommend) `rbenv` installed. Then, in cloned repo, run:

    rbenv install --skip-existing
    rbenv exec bundle install
    rbenv exec bundle exec ruby shape_loader.rb
    

## To play: 

- Use arrow keys to move.
- The goal is to pick up the right shapes and load them on the truck, left-to-right.
- press `ESC` to quit.

## Have fun!
